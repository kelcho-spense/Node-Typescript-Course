## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server, making it ideal for building scalable backend applications, APIs, and real-time services.

### Why Use TypeScript with Node.js?

TypeScript enhances Node.js by adding static typing, which improves code readability, maintainability, and early error detection. TypeScript’s integration with Node.js provides a smooth development experience, especially for large-scale applications.
